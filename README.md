# vimdoc-en

This project provides an HTML version of the Vim help pages at <http://vim-jp.org/vimdoc-en/>.

There is already another similar site: <http://vimhelp.appspot.com/>.
The main purpose of the vimdoc-en project is to provide a handy way to see both Japanese and English versions of the help pages.

The help pages are automatically updated everyday (if there are any changes).
