Here are some nice quotes about Vim that I collected from news and mail.<br>
<br>
<br>
vim (vim) noun - Ebullient vitality and energy.&nbsp;&nbsp;[Latin, accusative of vis,<br>
strength]&nbsp;&nbsp;(Dictionary)<br>
<br>
Vim is so much better than vi that a great many of my old vi :map's became<br>
immediately obsolete! (Tony Nugent, Australia)<br>
<br>
Coming with a very GUI mindset from Windows, I always thought of people using<br>
Vi as some kind of outer space alien in human clothes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once I tried I really<br>
got addicted by its power and now I found myself typing Vim keypresses in the<br>
oddest places! That's why I would like to see Vim embedded in every<br>
application which deals with text editing.&nbsp;&nbsp;(José Fonseca)<br>
<br>
I was a 12-year emacs user who switched to Vim about a year ago after finally<br>
giving up on the multiple incompatible versions, flaky contributed packages,<br>
disorganized keystrokes, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;And it was one of the best moves I ever made.<br>
(Joel Burton)<br>
<br>
Although all of the programs were used during the preparation of the new and<br>
revised material, most of the editing was done with Vim versions 4.5 and 5.0<br>
under GNU-Linux (Redhat 4.2).&nbsp;&nbsp;(Arnold Robbins, Israel, author of &quot;Learning<br>
the Vi editor&quot;)<br>
<br>
Out of all the open software i've ever seen and used, and i've seen a lot, Vim<br>
is the best, most useful and highest quality to work with, second only to the<br>
linux kernel itself.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Peter Jay Salzman)<br>
<br>
It's well worth noting that the _entirety_ of SourceForge was written using<br>
Vim and its nifty PHP syntax highlighting.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the entire SF.net tech<br>
staff uses Vim and we're all excited to have you aboard! (Tim Perdue)<br>
<br>
Vim is one of a select bunch of tools for which I have no substitute.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is<br>
a brilliant piece of work! (Biju Chacko)<br>
<br>
A previous girlfriend of mine switched to emacs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Needless to say, the<br>
relationship went nowhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Geoffrey Mann)<br>
<br>
I rarely think about Vim, in the same way that I guess a fish rarely thinks<br>
about water.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's the environment in which everything else happens.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm a<br>
fairly busy system administrator working on a lot of different platforms.&nbsp;&nbsp;Vim<br>
is the only thing that's consistent across all my systems, and it's just about<br>
the only thing that doesn't break from time to time.&nbsp;&nbsp;When a new system comes<br>
in the door without Vim, I install it right away.&nbsp;&nbsp;Great to have a tool that's<br>
the same everywhere, that's completely reliable, so I can ignore it and think<br>
about other things.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Pete Schaeffer)<br>
<br>
Having recently succeeded in running Vim via telnet through a Nokia<br>
Communicator, I can now report that it works nicely on a Palm Pilot too.<br>
(Allan Kelly, Scotland)<br>
<br>
You've done a tremendous job with 'VIM', Bram!&nbsp;&nbsp;The more I use it, the more<br>
impressed I get (I am an old&nbsp;<a class="Type" href="options.html#'vi'">'vi'</a>&nbsp;die hard who once started out with early<br>
versions of&nbsp;<span class="MissingTag">'emacs'</span>&nbsp;in the late 1970's and was relieved by finding&nbsp;<a class="Type" href="options.html#'vi'">'vi'</a>&nbsp;in the<br>
first UNIX I came across in 1983).&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, it's about time 'VIM'<br>
replace&nbsp;<span class="MissingTag">'emacs'</span>&nbsp;as the standard for top editors.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Bo Thide', Sweden)<br>
<br>
I love and use Vim heavily too.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Larry Wall)<br>
<br>
Vi is like a Ferrari, if you're a beginner, it handles like a bitch, but once<br>
you get the hang of it, it's small, powerful and FAST! (Unknown)<br>
Vim is like a new model Ferrari, and sounds like one too - &quot;VIIIIIIMMM!&quot;<br>
(Stephen Riehm, Germany)<br>
<br>
Schon bei Nutzung eines Bruchteils der Vim-Funktionen wird der Benutzer recht<br>
schnell die Vorzuege dieses Editors kennen- und schaetzenlernen.<br>
Translated: Even when only using a fraction of Vim-functions, the user will<br>
quickly get used to and appreciate the advantages of this editor.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Garry<br>
Glendown, conclusion of an article on Vim in iX magazine 9/1998)<br>
<br>
I've recently acquired the O'Reilly book on Vi (it also discusses Vim<br>
in-depth), and I'm amazed at just how powerful this application is.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Jeffrey<br>
Rankin)<br>
<br>
This guide was written using the Windows 9.x distribution of gvim, which is<br>
quite possibly the greatest thing to come along since God created the naked<br>
girl.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Michael DiBernardo)<br>
<br>
Boy, I thought I knew almost everything about Vim, but every time I browse the<br>
online documentation, I hit upon a minor but cool aspect of a Vim feature that<br>
I didn't know before!&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say the documentation is one the finest I've<br>
ever seen in a product -- even better than most commercial products.<br>
(Gautam Mudunuri)<br>
<br>
Vim 4.5 is really a fantastic editor.&nbsp;&nbsp;It has sooooo many features and more<br>
importantly, the defaults are so well thought out that you really don't have<br>
to change anything!!&nbsp;&nbsp;Words cannot express my amazement and gratitude to the<br>
creators of Vim.&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep it up.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Vikas, USA)<br>
<br>
I wonder how long it will be before people will refer to other Vi editors as<br>
Vim clones?&nbsp;&nbsp;(Darren Hiebert)<br>
<br>
I read about&nbsp;<span class="Special">[auto-positioning-in-file-based-on-the-errors-from-make]</span>&nbsp;in one<br>
of those &quot;Perfect Programmer's Editor&quot; threads and was delighted to discover<br>
that Vim already supports it.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Brendan Macmillan, Australia)<br>
<br>
I just discovered Vim (5.0) and I'm telling everyone I know about it!<br>
I tell them Vim stands for Vi for the new (M)illenium.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks so much!<br>
(Matt F. Valentine)<br>
<br>
I think from now on &quot;vi&quot; should be called &quot;Vim Imitation&quot;, not the other way<br>
around.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Rungun Ramanathan)<br>
<br>
The Law of Vim&#0058;<br>
For each member b of the possible behaviour space B of program P, there exists<br>
a finite time t before which at least one user u in the total user space U of<br>
program P will request b becomes a member of the allowed behaviour space B'<br>
(B' &lt;= B).<br>
In other words: Sooner or later everyone wants everything as an option.<br>
(Negri)<br>
<br>
Whenever I move to a new computing platform, the first thing I do is to port<br>
Vim.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lately, I am simply stunned by its ease of compilation using the<br>
configure facility.&nbsp;&nbsp;(A.M. Sabuncu, Turkey)<br>
<br>
The options are really excellent and very powerful.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Anish Maharaj)<br>
<br>
The Spring user-interface designs are in, and word from the boutiques is that<br>
80x24 text-only mode is back with a *vengeance! Vi editor clone Vim burst onto<br>
March desk-tops with a dazzling show of pastel syntax highlights for its 5.0<br>
look.&nbsp;&nbsp;Strident and customizable, Vim raises eyebrows with its interpretation<br>
of the classic Vi single-key macro collection.<br>

<br>
I just wanted to take this opportunity to let you know that Vim 5 ROCKS!<br>
Syntax highlighting: how did I survive without it?!&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you for creating<br>
mankind's best editor!&nbsp;&nbsp;(Mun Johl, USA)<br>
<br>
Thanks again for Vim.&nbsp;&nbsp;I use it every day on Linux.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Eric Foster-Johnson,<br>
author of the book &quot;UNIX Programming Tools&quot;)<br>
<br>
The BEST EDITOR EVER (Stuart Woolford)<br>
<br>
I have used most of Vim's fancy features at least once, many frequently, and I<br>
can honestly say that I couldn't live with anything less anymore.&nbsp;&nbsp;My<br>
productivity has easily doubled compared to what it was when I used vi.<br>
(Sitaram Chamarty)<br>
<br>
I luv Vim.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is incredible.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm naming my first-born Vimberly.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Jose<br>
Unpingco, USA)<br>
<br>
Hint:&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Vim&quot; is &quot;vi improved&quot; - much better! (Sven Guckes, Germany)<br>
<br>
I use Vim every day.&nbsp;&nbsp;I spend more time in Vim than in any other program...<br>
It's the best vi clone there is.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it's great.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Craig Sanders,<br>
Australia)<br>
<br>
I strongly advise using Vim--its infinite undo/redo saved me much grief.<br>
(Terry Brown)<br>
<br>
Thanks very much for writing what in my opinion is the finest text editor on<br>
the planet.&nbsp;&nbsp;If I were to get another cat, I would name it &quot;Vim&quot;.<br>
(Bob Sheehan, USA)<br>
<br>
I typed :set all and the screen FILLED up with options.&nbsp;&nbsp;A whole screen of<br>
things to be set and unset.&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw some of my old friends like wrapmargin,<br>
modelines and showmode, but the screen was FILLED with new friends!&nbsp;&nbsp; I love<br>
them all!&nbsp;&nbsp; I love Vim!&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm so happy that I've found this editor!&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel<br>
like how I once felt when I started using vi after a couple of years of using<br>
ed.&nbsp;&nbsp;I never thought I'd forsake my beloved ed, but vi ... oh god, vi was<br>
great.&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, Vim.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Peter Jay Salzman, USA)<br>
<br>
I am really happy with such a wonderful software package.&nbsp;&nbsp;Much better than<br>
almost any expensive, off the shelf program.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Jeff Walker)<br>
<br>
Whenever I reread the Vim documentation I'm overcome with excitement at the<br>
power of the editor.&nbsp;&nbsp;(William Edward Webber, Australia)<br>
<br>
Hurrah for Vim!! It is &quot;at your fingertips&quot; like vi, and has the extensions<br>
that vi sorely needs: highlighting for executing commands on blocks, an easily<br>
navigable and digestible help screen, and more.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Paul Pax)<br>
<br>
The reason WHY I don't have this amazingly useful macro anymore, is that I<br>
now use Vim - and this is built in!! (Stephen Riehm, Germany)<br>
<br>
I am a user of Vim and I love it.&nbsp;&nbsp;I use it to do all my programming, C,<br>
C++, HTML what ever.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Tim Allwine)<br>
<br>
I discovered Vim after years of struggling with the original vi, and I just<br>
can't live without it anymore.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Emmanuel Mogenet, USA)<br>
<br>
Emacs has not a bit of chance to survive so long as Vim is around.&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides,<br>
it also has the most detailed software documentation I have ever seen---much<br>
better than most commercial software!&nbsp;&nbsp;(Leiming Qian)<br>
<br>
This version of Vim will just blow people apart when they discover just how<br>
fantastic it is! (Tony Nugent, Australia)<br>
<br>
I took your advice &amp; finally got Vim &amp; I'm really impressed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Instant convert.<br>
(Patrick Killelea, USA)<br>
<br>
Vim is by far my favorite piece of shareware and I have been particularly<br>
pleased with version 3.0.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is really a solid piece of work.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Robert<br>
Colon, USA)<br>
<br>
Vim is a joy to use, it is so well thought and practical that I wonder why<br>
anybody would use visual development tools.&nbsp;&nbsp;Vim is powerful and elegant, it<br>
looks deceptively simple but is almost as complex as a 747 (especially when I<br>
look at my growing .vimrc), keep up that wonderful job, Vim is a centerpiece<br>
of the free software world.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Louis-David Mitterand, USA)<br>
<br>
I cannot believe how great it is to use Vim.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the guys at work are<br>
getting tired of hearing me bragging about it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Others eyes are lighting up.<br>
(Rick Croote)<br>
<br>
Emacs takes way too much time to start up and run, it is too big and bulky for<br>
effective use and the interface is more confusing than it is of any help.&nbsp;&nbsp;Vim<br>
however is short, it is fast, it is powerful, it has a good interface and it<br>
is all purpose.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Paal Ditlefsen Ekran)<br>
<br>
From the first time I got Vim3.0, I was very enthusiastic.&nbsp;&nbsp;It has almost no<br>
problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;The swapfile handling and the backup possibilities are robust, also<br>
the protection against editing one file twice.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very compatible to the<br>
real VI (and that is a MUST, because my brain is trained over years in using<br>
it).&nbsp;&nbsp;(Gert van Antwerpen, Holland)<br>
<br>
Visual mode in Vim is a very powerful thing! (Tony Nugent, Australia)<br>
<br>
I have to say that Vim is =THE= single greatest piece of source code to ever<br>
come across the net (Jim Battle, USA).<br>
<br>
In fact, if you do want to get a new vi I'd suggest Vim-3.0.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is, by<br>
far, the best version of vi I've ever seen (Albert W. Schueller).<br>
<br>
I should mention that Vim is a very good editor and can compete with anything<br>
(Ilya Beloozerov).<br>
<br>
To tell the truth sometimes I used elvis, vile, xvi, calvin, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;And this is<br>
the reason that I can state that Vim is the best! (Ferenc Deak, Hungary)<br>
<br>
Vim is by far the best editor that I have used in a long time, and I have<br>
looked at just about every thing that is available for every platform that I<br>
use.&nbsp;&nbsp;Vim is the best on all of them.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Guy L. Oliver)<br>
<br>
Vim is the greatest editor since the stone chisel.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Jose Unpingco, USA)<br>
<br>
I would like to say that with Vim I am finally making the 'emacs to vi'<br>
transition - as an Editor it is so much better in many ways: keyboard layout,<br>
memory usage, text alteration to name 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Mark Adam)<br>
<br>
In fact, now if I want to know what a particular setting does in vi, I fire up<br>
Vim and check out its help!&nbsp;&nbsp;(Nikhil Patel, USA)<br>
<br>
As a vi user, Vim has made working with text a far more pleasant task than<br>
before I encountered this program.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Steinar Knutsen, Norway)<br>
<br>
I use Vim since version 3.0.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since that time, it is the ONLY editor I use,<br>
with Solaris, Linux and OS/2 Warp.&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest all my friends to use Vim, they<br>
try, and they continue using it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Vim is really the best software I have ever<br>
downloaded from the Internet, and the best editor I know of.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Marco<br>
Eccettuato, Italy)<br>
